# CrossFoodBliss-Website
It is a food websiteHello there!!üòÅ People find it difficult in choosing eatables on basis of Food allergies or Instagram Introduced Diets or practices like veganism. So, I have created a website that connects all the above categories and can provide recipes for all kinds of meals.This website is very basic and helpful for people who have just started working as front-end developer. 
Technlogies used are-HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, BOOTSTRAP. Also, I have added a small ppt which describes the website in a very pleasing way.ü•∞
